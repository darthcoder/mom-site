I am a simple Lady with a passion for life who believes in living life on her own terms. Cooking is the greatest 
of all art forms. Instead of colors we have flavours. 

A good meal can cheer up when you are heartbroken and bring the most sane persons to tears if the flavours are not
well matched. 

I have spent my life in the kitchen. And I have mastered the culinary arts. I am Nemat Ahmad, I drink chai tea and
I cook wondorous things. 

Things with a lot of flavours are easy to make. The tastes are overpowering and it is easy to satiate a person.

I am however, also proficient in making mouth watering healthy food. Who said that healthy food has to be tasteless?

In this new world of blogs, youtube Instagram and facebook, I have discovered the greatest university of culinary 
arts and I want to share my knowledge and passion with fellow foodies. 

Because no matter how much you earn, you can spend it all on restaurants. And even if you earn a little less, but know
how to cook, you can satiate yourself. 

And in today's hypercompetitive world, perhaps what is lacking the most is the time to sit quietly and watch 
your tea turn green.
